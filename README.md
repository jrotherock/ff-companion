# Draft Companion

Personal fantasy football draft assistant for the 2026 season. Four leagues,
three Yahoo and one Sleeper, all snake redraft.

The design constraint that drives everything: **the local app owns canonical
draft state, and every input source is a replaceable sensor.** Manual entry is
always live and is never a mode you have to enter. If every automated feed dies
mid-draft, the tool still works.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run data:players      # canonical player map + bye weeks
npm run data:rankings     # BEER+ boards, one per league
npm run data:adjustments  # big-play rates and value calibration (optional)
npm start                 # http://localhost:4600
```

Node lives at `~/.local/node` on this machine; there is no Homebrew.

## Layout

```
src/
  kernel/        pure, offline, no network
    state.ts       pick log, applySnapshot, diffing
    snake.ts       closed-form snake position math
    value.ts       VOR, tiers, survival, VONA, run detection
    opponents.ts   opponent-aware survival (calibrated, see below)
    roster.ts      slots, needs, bye conflicts
    adjust.ts      scoring rules the ranking source cannot express
    preferences.ts likes/avoids and roster-construction rules
    explain.ts     the short case for or against one player
    match.ts       cross-platform name resolution
  adapters/      sensors — emit full snapshots, contain no logic
    sleeper.ts     public REST poll, no auth
    yahoo-ext.ts   receives snapshots pushed by the browser extension
  server/        HTTP + WebSocket, append-only pick log
data/            league configs, player map, rankings, preferences
fixtures/        recorded drafts for replay and calibration
scripts/         data pipeline and calibration harnesses
```

Adapters emit **full snapshots, not incremental events.** The kernel diffs, so
every source is idempotent and order-independent, and a sensor that drops
offline for thirty seconds recovers by itself.

## Platform notes

- **Sleeper** picks are public and unauthenticated. Poll every 2s.
- **Yahoo** `/f1/<id>/draftresults` is a plain server-rendered page carrying the
  full pick log. Polling it from any Yahoo tab is far more robust than reading
  React state in the draft room, needs no API approval, and works even when
  drafting from the phone. `?draft_results_period=previous` returns last
  season's draft, which is where the calibration fixtures come from.
- **Sleeper's `yahoo_id` is missing for roughly 45% of players**, including
  recent rookies. Cross-platform joins resolve by name, position and team.
- **Yahoo randomises draft order ~30 minutes before the draft**, so the draft
  slot cannot be set ahead of time.
- **TapThatDraft** config POSTs mint a permanent UUID URL. The board is a lazily
  hydrated Livewire component, so its `__lazyLoad` call has to be replayed.

## Opponent model

Survival to your next pick starts from ADP, then adjusts for the specific teams
picking in between — a team with two backs already is not taking a third.

Parameters were fitted on the real 2025 Fantasy Steward draft and validated on
the real 2025 Harker Green draft, which has different managers, a three-receiver
roster and fifteen rounds, and had no influence on the fit:

| | Steward (fitted) | Green (held out) | Green majority baseline |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| top-1 accuracy | 50.0% | **51.7%** | 40.8% |
| logloss | 1.4503 | **1.1485** | 1.7918 (uniform) |

Three findings shaped the model:

1. **Opponents draft by ADP, not by value over replacement.** Scoring by BEER+
   value did worse than always guessing the most common position.
2. **The first guess at softmax temperature was four times too sharp**, which
   produced 0% and 100% survival claims the data does not support.
3. **Late rounds are a different game.** A model fitted across all rounds fails
   catastrophically out of sample, so the model stands aside after round 10 —
   where survival stops mattering anyway.

Per-position need weights were tried and **rejected**: they fit Steward well and
generalised worse than a single uniform weight.

The model is validated at the *position* level only. It has no demonstrated
skill at choosing between two players at the same position, so it informs the
survival estimate rather than driving it (`DEFAULT_ADP_WEIGHT = 0.72`).

Re-run the analysis with `npx tsx scripts/crossval.ts`.

## Testing it live

**Sleeper — works today.** Sleeper mock drafts create real draft ids, so the
adapter can be pointed at one without touching any config:

```bash
# start a mock at sleeper.com, then take the id out of the draft-room URL
SLEEPER_DRAFT_ID=1234567890123456789 npm run dev
```

Picks appear within two seconds of being made. The league's own draft id is the
default when the variable is unset.

**Yahoo — load the extension in `extension/`.** Chrome → `chrome://extensions`
→ Developer mode → Load unpacked. Then open any Yahoo fantasy page and leave it
open; the toolbar popup shows whether it can see the companion and how many
picks it has pushed.

The sensor polls Yahoo's own draft results page rather than reading the draft
room, which is why it needs no API approval, survives a redesign, and keeps
working while you draft from the phone. It matches the whole fantasysports
domain rather than a draft-room URL, because matching on URL shape is exactly
the failure this design exists to avoid.

Yahoo offline drafts populate that page only after the commissioner enters the
picks, so for those the sensor is a verification pass and manual entry is the
live path.

## Draft-night rules

- Never block the UI. Adapter failure shows a stale badge with seconds since
  last update. No spinners, no modal errors.
- Two-second answer. One screen, huge type, no scroll.
- Print the tiered cheat sheet. Paper is the last fallback and costs nothing.
- Set Yahoo pre-draft rankings in every league as the autopick fallback.
