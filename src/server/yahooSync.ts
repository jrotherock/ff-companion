/**
 * The Yahoo leagues, kept current from the API.
 *
 * Four features were built against data the browser sensor could never
 * supply — the trade finder, the opponent's lineup, the transaction digest and
 * the luck split — and sat dark all season behind "no league-wide capture
 * yet". This fills the stores they read, so they light up without changing.
 *
 * Cheap on purpose. Every league-wide question is asked once for all the
 * leagues together, which Yahoo allows (`leagues;league_keys=a,b,c/...`), so
 * a round is a handful of requests however many leagues there are. The only
 * per-league calls are the two lineups in a head-to-head week — mine and his —
 * because Yahoo will not nest a week's points inside a multi-team collection:
 * asked for, they are silently dropped.
 *
 * Each part keeps its own clock and its own last good answer. A round that
 * fails at transactions still delivers the scoreboard, and a failed part leaves
 * what it read last time exactly where it was: a stale digest is worth having,
 * an empty one is a false statement about the league.
